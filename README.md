# SCRUD App

## Search, Create, Read, Update

This app deals with a one to many relationship between Students and their Campus.

I wanted to explore filtering, searching, sorting, and load times. I used pagination on the All Campus page and applied filtering on the backend.

Students uses filtering on the front end but does not use pagination. The load time is slower but it was simpler to implement sorting and searching.
